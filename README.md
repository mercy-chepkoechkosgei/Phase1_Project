## Aviation Risk Analysis for Business Expansion
### Overview
This repository analyzes NTSB aviation accident data (1948–2023) to identify low-risk aircraft models engine types, and robust airplane make. The goal is to provide data-driven insights supporting the company's safe expansion into aviation operations.
## Business Understanding
### Stakeholder 
Our Company new aviation division .
### Key Business Questions

Which aircraft manufacturers and models exhibit the lowest severe injury?
Which aircraft engines are safest and reliable?
which aicraft manufactures demonstrate low damage rates?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Data Source 
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) civil aviation accidents and incidents dataset. Access the data [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v3/tree/master/data).
### Data Description: 
~90,000 records with details on event date, manufacturer/make, model, engine type, purpose of flight, aircraft damage (Destroyed/Substantial/Minor), and injuries (fatal, serious, minor, uninjured).
## Key Visualizations
 ### Top Airplane Make
 A bar chart showing the top make by volume of incidents recorded.
Cessna dominates in volume indicating it is preferred make in the aviation industry.
### Damage Severity Proportions by Top Manufacturers
The 100% stacked bar chart shows the proportional breakdown of aircraft
damage levels for the five most common manufacturers in the dataset
(Cessna, Piper, Beech, Mooney, Cirrus).
The chart suggests that while Cessna and Piper dominate incidents due
to popularity, their outcomes are mostly repairable (sustainable) rather
than catastrophic( Destroyed).
### Engine Type Safety for Top Manufacturer
A line chart demonstrating the stability of different engines over time.
### Interactive Dashboard
The dashboard with the visualizations can be accesed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mercy.chepkoech/viz/Dashboard_17662604549870/Dashboard3?publish=yes).
## Conclusion
High-volume manufacturers like Cessna and Piper, while leading in incidents due to popularity, predominantly experience Substantial (repairable) damage with low proportions of total loss—viable when operated professionally. The reliable engine type for commercial operation is reciprocating engine as it has the lowest and stable injury severity rate.
These insights confirm that targeted selection of aircraft, engine types, and purposes enables low-risk participation in a maturing, safer aviation market.
